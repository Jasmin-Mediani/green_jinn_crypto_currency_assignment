In tradingPairs.js I'd like to have *only* the selected card with a different background color (I would like to make it become like a bootstrap active item... the best I could do for now is to color it via hover but in order to have a good UX/UI it's not enough)


The Chart in Chart.js could be better. It was the toughest part to do, but I see it can be improved: I would like to make the Chart to reload after 1 minute or - even better - to constantly update its values so that the last value always disappears after the new one has been added 
[... guess it's a combination of .shift()/.pop() and .append()/.prepend()]


The first value of the Chart should appear 1 second after clicking the pair... now it starts after 10 seconds as set in setInterval...


This one is just a note (not an improvement) due to a choice I made:
The component on the left (the cost of a bitcoin) is a "stand-alone" component: it calls the API and has its logic, so it's not reusable. To make it reusable I should let the App component make the call and pass the result as a property.
